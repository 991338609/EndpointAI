- This library is a research project focused on the software developer's business
- This is a software interface for a stream-based computing, made for RTOS or bare metal
- This framework integrates a scheduler and manages the data moves and format changes

The purpose is to :
1 Avoid the system integrator to worry with software components implementation and interface details
2 Avoid the software component developer to bother about integration, memory map and peripherals
3 Let more software developers join our ecosystem, and prepare a path for monetization
4 Create a graphical environment to enable fast DSP/ML prototyping
5 Create a safe and secure environement
6 Solve the limitations of memory-bounded algorithms and get performance scalability with multiprocessing
